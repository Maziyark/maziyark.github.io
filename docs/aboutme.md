I'm a mechanical/biomedical engineer by training with a passion for computational mechanobiology and AI. I'm highly skilled in Java programming, MATLAB/python scripting, Agent-Based Modeling, and of course FEA simulations (ANSYS Workbench, APDL scripting, and COMSOL).

I have developed a coupled AB-FEA (Agent Based - Finite Element Analysis) modeling framework to study growth and remodeling in blood vessels in which the Agent-Based Model simulates the interactions of the cells and the FEA calculates the stress/strain distributions. You can find the graphical outline of the modeling framework [here](https://maziyark.github.io/InSilico_TEVG/).   

Our research is funded by the American Heart Association ([AHA Predoctoral Fellowship and SDG](https://professional.heart.org/idc/groups/ahamah-public/@wcm/@sop/@rsch/documents/downloadable/ucm_433355.pdf)) and the NIH ([5R01HL136776-02](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=9618585&icde=46505989&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=)).
